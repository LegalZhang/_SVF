In preparing this artifact, we have modified files from an open-source project. As part of this process, we have removed the original author's name from the modified files to ensure anonymity. However, some unmodified files may still contain references to the original author, as removing them entirely could impact the integrity of the artifact. We have made a reasonable effort to maintain double-blinding while ensuring the artifact remains functional and true to its source.
